## Overview
The HabiTrack system is designed to give emphasis on wildlife tracking and conservation efforts. By providing a platform for efficient data collection, management, and analysis on species locations and behaviors, HabiTrack gives way to contribute to environmental and wilflife exctinction. This system streamlines the process of recording crucial wildlife data, where users can gain insights to wildlife populations, indentify where they were spotted and found, and lastly track them. HabiTrack aims to foster a deeper understanding of wildlife ecology and facilitate mmeasures to protect endagered species and their habitats.

## Python Concepts and Libraries Used
The application integrates several key Python concepts and libraries to make its GUI and manage their interactions.

- Object Oriented Programming (OOP): The system uses OOP specifically Abstraction and Encapsulation to hide the implementation of databases query from the main program.

- Tkinter: TThe GUI or Graphical User Interface is created using Tkinter, which provides interactive buttons, label, entry fields, menus for the user to engage in the tracking system.

- Error Handling: To ensure that the user inputs the correct values in the system, error handling is implemented using messageboxes and warning messages are displayed if any fields were missing or incorrect.

## Integration with SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)
