## Overview
The HabiTrack system is designed to give emphasis on wildlife tracking and conservation efforts. By providing a platform for efficient data collection, management, and analysis on species locations and behaviors, HabiTrack gives way to contribute to environmental and wilflife exctinction. This system streamlines the process of recording crucial wildlife data, where users can gain insights to wildlife populations, indentify where they were spotted and found, and lastly track them. HabiTrack aims to foster a deeper understanding of wildlife ecology and facilitate mmeasures to protect endagered species and their habitats.

## Python Concepts and Libraries Used
The application integrates several key Python concepts and libraries to make its GUI and manage their interactions.

- Object Oriented Programming (OOP): The system uses OOP specifically Abstraction and Encapsulation to hide the implementation of databases query from the main program.

- Tkinter: TThe GUI or Graphical User Interface is created using Tkinter, which provides interactive buttons, label, entry fields, menus for the user to engage in the tracking system.

- Error Handling: To ensure that the user inputs the correct values in the system, error handling is implemented using messageboxes and warning messages are displayed if any fields were missing or incorrect.

## Integration with SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)

The HabiTrack Wildlife Tracking System aligns with SDG 15: Life On Land by tracking wildlife populations and their locations, HabiTrack Provides data for understanding the threats of extinction and addresses the threats to biodiversity.

- Tracking the wildlife that can be found around us can be beneficial to us since extinction is increasing rapidly and is a major problem. By tracking where these wildlife can be found, we can locate and find them to protect these creatures from poachers and possible captures of wildlife.

## Instructions for Running the Program

I. Download all of the files and extract them.

II. When The files are downloaded, open up the HabiTrack.py and run it.

1. When the system starts, you will be met with a login form. Input all of the necessary details and then login.
2. The Main System will then pop up.
3. Select which page you're willing top visit first.
- Status Page: This is where you can track the number of species that are currently tracked
- Track Page: This is where you can input and track the wildlife you can encounter with
- SDG page: This is where you'll find the sdg the HabiTrack System is aligned with.
